# My Personal Project

## Project Description

*What* will the application do?  
The application will help tutors keep track of their tutoring record, including the tutoring hours with different students and the details of each student.

*Who* will use it?  
The main target users for this application is tutors, who could have an arbitary number of tutoring hours with different students. This application is particularly useful for tutors who have a lot of students.

*Why* is this project of interest to me?  
As a part-time tutor who work with several students at the same time, I find it challenging to track my tutoring hours for each student clearly. Hence, I want to design an application that could allow tutors to record their tutoring hours systematically.
